# Blog-Recommendation

This project builds a medical blog recommendation system that connects to MongoDB Database based on the information extracted by TF-IDF algorithm. As a result, websiteâ€™s Daily Active Users (DAU) increased by 13%. 

By running Fit.py, it uses pymongo and can automatically read all the blogs stored in MongoDB every two days. Then, it will output two similarity matrixes which are calculated by TF-IDF Algorithm on blog content and blog abstract. 

By running Recommend.py, which requires passage ID as an input, it loads the similarity matrixes calculated by Fit.py and outputs the top N similar blogs' ID.
